		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can remember my childhood was fun.<sup>1</sup> I was given almost everything I need.<sup>2</sup> 
		In fact I may have been spoiled during my years as a child.<sup>3</sup> My dad would always buy me and my little brother pokemon cards.<sup>4</sup> 
		I actually didnt care if they were authentic or not.<sup>5</sup> I was really hooked on pokemon as a child.<sup>6</sup> I even played some of its game on an emulator on our pc. <sup>7</sup> 
		I think the number of pokemon cards we owned could fill a whole crate!<sup>8</sup> Digimon was also one of my favorites back then.<sup>9</sup> 
		I would watch the anime every morning at 6 or 7.<sup>10</sup> I also played its games on the first Playstation.<sup>11</sup> 
		Dont get me wrong I had friends back then but they were almost an hour a way by car.<sup>12</sup>
		Plus the only times we did meet was at school.<sup>13</sup> Another reason is my parents were protective of me and thats why I cant go to their houses.<sup>14</sup> 
		I did play with some the kids from our subdivision.<sup>15</sup>  But during my childhood I had video games and my siblings to keep me company.<sup>16</sup>
		I may have even spent more time playing than socializing.<sup>17</sup> And that is probably why Im vert introverted.<sup>18</sup> 
		But I dont regret that since I like keeping my social circle small.<sup>19</sup>Because smaller social circles give you high quality friends.<sup>20</sup> 
		You alaso create strong bonds that lasts for years <sup>21</sup>

	<div style="text-align:justify;font-size: 0.90 em">
	<blockquote><blockquote><p style = "font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where my dark days came.<sup>1</sup> I was raised in Quezon City during my childhood.<sup>2</sup> 
	But we moved to Bulacan after finishing Grade 6.<sup>3</sup> The first year was hard on me. <sup>4</sup>I misssed my friends and of course the memories I had there growing up.<sup>5</sup>
	Not only that but I was more accustomed to an urban area.<sup>6</sup> My years at high school was very bumpy.<sup>7</sup> During this time my acne was so severe. My hairstyle was not good. <sup>8</sup> 
	I did some questionable things.<sup>9</sup> And of course, embarassed myself alot.<sup>10</sup> I tried to visit my old school in QC a twice or thrice, but after that I lost contact with them.<sup>11</sup>
	But even if those crappy things happened I was able to meet some good friends.<sup>12</sup> In fact, they are my main group until now.<sup>13</sup> During my teenage years I was still introverted. <sup>14</sup> 
	My parents were still and protective about me sleeping over my friends houses.<sup>15</sup> Whats funny is that their houses are just a few minutes by bike from ours. <sup>16</sup> 
	One memorable thing I did back then was the time I spent playing basketball.<sup>17</sup> My high school friends and I would play from 10 or 11 AM to 5 or 6 AM.<sup>18</sup> 
	This was the reason Im kinda skinny.<sup>19</sup> But I made up for it as the years progressed.<sup>20</sup>

    <h2 style = "text-align: center;font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif; font-variant: small-caps; font-style: oblique; font-weight:1250px; color: #EE7C55">College Years</h2>
	<div style="text-align:justify;font-size: 0.90 em">
	<blockquote><blockquote><p style = "font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my college years. <sup>1</sup> I was'nt that scared when I first started though. <sup>2</sup> 
	The only I was worried about if I would be able to make new friends. <sup>3</sup> I was probably overthinking this since I was able to mmake some.<sup>4</sup>
	During this time I knew I had to take my studies seriously.<sup>5</sup> Since this would definitely be my stepping stone to a good profession. <sup>6</sup>
	Programming was tough during my first encounter with it. <sup>7</sup> I couldnt even understand simpe terms or even create my own program.<sup>8</sup> 
	But during my second year I was able to somewhat understand it and even build my first program.<sup>9</sup> 
	I encountered miniscule number of problems during my first year.<sup>10</sup> But during the second half of it unfortunate events occured. <sup>11</sup>
	The taal volcano eruption that left a ton of casualties and left residents homeless.<sup>12</sup> The start of the pandemic that out government wasnt able to handle very well. <sup>13</sup> 
	The lockdown that made us felt jailed within our homes.<sup>14</sup> I finally decided to gain some weight. <sup>15</sup> So bought a pull up bar and started calisthenics.<sup>16</sup> 
	Calisthenics tarining focuses only on body weight moviements.<sup>17</sup> You build strength and muscle during the progress.<sup>18</sup>
	Building muscle is slower though compared to using free weights.<sup>19</sup> I saw some results and now Im not that skinny anymore. I still have a long journey ahead of me.<sup>20</sup>
	I just hope my drive for determination and success would get stronger.<sup>21</sup>
